Lord Of The Rings Quote Generator

I created this Quote generator based off the knowledge of a past tutorial, except for this project

- I had to learn how to create a json file and make it live,
  
- I had to learn how to randomly get a value from an array,
  
- I had to learn to learn more about the fetch method and how to manipulate it to work display the random value.
  
- I had to learn how to give the user the ability to tweet the displayed quote to Twitter.

After learning how to do the above I successfully pulled a randomized quote and author from my json file and got it to display.
